<h2>About ADAM</h2>
<p>
    ADAM, which stands for Advanced Decision-Making and Management, is a web-based tool used for analyzing and solving <b>organic waste management (OWM)</b> problems. These OWM problems often involve the interactions bewteen <b>concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)</b>, waste management plants, cropfields, and external customers. ADAM takes these interactions into account in order to determine the most economically-favorable pathways that the waste should take.

<p>
By using ADAM, we can effiently make case studies to explore the effects of farm concentration, product price changes, government incentives, etc. These case studies can then be used as a teaching tool to learn about a systems approach to waste managment, or can be used to futher research.
