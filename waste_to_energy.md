<h1>Waste to Energy</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    The Waste to Energy case study is a model involving a system of CAFOs, technology sites, and demand nodes. The CAFOs act as the suppliers of cow manure. They can choose to either process the cow manure at a technolocy site or dispose of it at a disposal facility.

<p>
    The technology sites contain anaerobic digestion and electricity generation technologies (shown below) which are able to process cow manure into bio-electricity and digestate. The digestate is a waste product that can be applied to cropfields or disposed of, and the bio-electricity can be sold to and used by customers.

<p>
    Given this system, we would like to know (1) how much waste is processed by the technology sites, (2) how much bio-electricity is produced, (3) and if this system profitable (i.e. do we earn more money from selling bio-electricity than we pay through transportation and operating costs?)
</p>

<p>
    Running this system through ADAM will give us the optimal (i.e. most economically favorable) result. However, this does not mean that the system will be profitable; sometimes the most favorable result is the one with the least losses. When the transportation and operating costs outweigh the earnings from selling bioelectricity, CAFOs will not process any of their waste and instead will choose to dispose of it. In order to encourage CAFOs to process their waste, the price of bio-electricity must be adjusted so that processing the waste is profitable. 
</p>

<p>
    In this case study, we will analyze the effect of three different electricity prices: low price, market price, and high price.
