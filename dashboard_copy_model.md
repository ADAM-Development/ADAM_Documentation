<h1>Making a Copy of a Published Case Study</h1>

<p>
    The case studies section of the dashboard contains published case studies that are already defined and solved. In addition to viewing these case studies and their results, you can make copies of these case studies, edit them, and try running them for yourself.
</p>

<p>
    In this tutorial, we will go through the steps of copying a case study into your model list.
</p>


<h2>Step 1: Navigate to the Desired Case Study</h2>

<h2>Step 2: Make a copy</h2>

Once you have navigated to the case study, and click **Make a Copy**. Note that the copy will only contain one scenario so be sure to adjust to the desired scenario before you click **Make a Copy**.

Once you have clicked **Make a Copy** a popup window will appear, prompting you to edit the model name. Change the model name as desired and click **Yes**. This will create a copy of the Low Electricity Price scenario for the Waste to Energy case study.

Once you have created a copy of the model, you can make changes to it or run it as is. In the next section of the tutorial, we will go over how to run the case study as is. After that, we will go over the various changes you can make to the case study data.
