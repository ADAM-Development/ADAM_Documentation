<h1>FERC Order NO. 2222</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    On September 17, 2020, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commision (FERC) issued order No. 2222. This policy removed the cost barriers that were limiting distributed energy resources (DERs), allowing them to compete alongside traditional electricity resources. 
</p>

<p>
    DERs are small-scale power generation or energy storage technologies used locally. Some examples of DERs are rooftop solar panels, biomass generators, fuel cells, and electric vehicles. With Order No. 2222, these technologies will be more easily obtainable by the average citizen; this allows the power grid becomes more flexible and resiliant since there is less reliance on centralized power generation sites. 
</p>

<p>
    This case study demonstrates the impacts of FERC Order No. 2222 through two scenarios, one representing the system before Order No. 2222 was issued and the other representing the system after. In order to simplify the system, we assumed that the entire electricity demand for the state of Wisconsin was located at a centralized point: Milwaukee, WI. 
</p>

<p>
    The first scenario we explore is the system under the old policy (i.e. before Order No. 2222 was issued). In this scenario, we add a pseudo technology, labeled "Electricity Cost Increase", to the end of the biogas supply chain (shown below) in order to represent the additional cost barrier for DERs. The new policy (i.e. after Order No. 2222 was issued) removes the Electricity Cost Increase technology, resulting in lower operating costs for producing electricity.
