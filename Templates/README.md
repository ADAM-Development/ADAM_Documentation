# Templates 

This subdirectory contains template CSV files for inputting supply, demand, technology site, and technology candidate data. These files can then be used for creating case studies in [ADAM](http://54.208.179.171:8000/)

## Supply File 

The supply file contains data on the location, price, and yield of a waste product. 
For models in ADAM, the supply of waste product is cow manure produced by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (known as CAFOs). <br>

The template supply file will look similar to the example below: 


| # | Latitude | Longitude | Product ID | Price | Capacity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| s1 | 43.835418 | -88.293544 | p5 | 0 | 1000 |
