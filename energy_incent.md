<h1>Energy Incentives</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    In the energy incentive case study, we have a system of CAFOs which are simultaneously a supply node, demand node, and a technology candidate. These CAFOs supply cow manure, demand bio-electricity along with manure derivatives, and are technology candidates for Anaerobic Digestion and Electricity generation technology. 
</p>

<p>
    We are assuming that the CAFO locally consumes the electricity and locally applies the manure products to the croplands. The energy incentives refer to the price increase of electricity. In other words, zero incentives means that the electricity is being offered at market price, $0.04 incentives means that the electricity is being offered at $0.04 higher than market price, and $0.10 incentives means that the electricity is being offered at $0.10 above market price.

<p>
    For this case study, we are exploring the effect of energy incentives on building technologies and processing waste. As the price of electricity goes up (i.e. as energy incentives increase), it will become more valuable for CAFOs to build technologies to process their waste into bio-electricity. 
</p>

<h2>Case 1: $0 USD/kWh</h2>

<p>
    For case 1, the price of electricity is set to zero (i.e. electricity is at market price). This gives CAFOs no incentive to process their waste. As a result, no technologies are built and all of the waste gets locally applied onto the surrounding croplands.

<h2>Case 2: $0.04 USD/kWh</h2>

<p>
    For case 2, the energy incentive is set to $0.04 USD/kWh. By increasing the price of electricity, CAFOs are encouraged to install technologies so that they can process waste into electricty instead of continuing to purchase electricity from an outside source. As a result, some of the CAFOs decided that installing the technology was worth it. Surrounding farms were then able to send their waste to the sites that installed technologies.

<p>
    Since the energy incentives are fairly low, most farms felt that the cost of installing and operating the technologies outweighed the amount of money saved by processing the waste into bio-electricity. At $0.08 USD/kWh, there are very little technologies installed and very little waste processed. 
</p>

<h2>Case 3: $0.10 USD/kWh</h2>

<p>
For case 3, the energy incentive is raised to $0.10 USD/kWh, resulting in a few more farms installing technologies. The surrounding CAFOs can then send their waste to the nearby technology site without having to build their own technology site. As a result, more waste is being processed.
