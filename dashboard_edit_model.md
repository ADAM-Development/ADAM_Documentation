<h1>Editing the Model</h1>

<p>
    Now that you have learned how to make a copy and run a case study, we will now go over how to edit the information in the case study. Knowing how to edit a case study allows you to make alterations to the case study as you please in order to explore different scenarios. 
</p>

<p>
    This tutorial will go over each step in the model and demonstrate the changes you can make to the model. 
</p>

<h2>Step 1 - Model Type</h2>

<p>
    Step 1 is where the model type is defined. For most situations, you should leave the model type and time basis of a copied model as is. If the model type does not match the data, ADAM will be unable to run the model. If you are not sure, it is best to set it to supply chain design mode on a yearly time basis.

<p>
    In this example, we can see that the copied model is a design-type model with an annual time basis.

<h2>Step 2 - Supply Data</h2>

<p>
    For step 2, you can double-click the nodes from the case study to edit their information.

<p>
    In addition to editing existing nodes, you may also add new data. <b>Upload Data</b> is used when you have a csv file containing data points you would like to add. Otherwise, you can add a singular node by selecting <b>Manual Entry</b> and then filling out the required information. <b>Load from Model</b> allows you to select other models from your model list and import their data into this model.

<p>
    If you upload the wrong file, you can use <b>Clear Data</b> to clear all supply data from the model. The final option, <b>Look for a Feedstock</b>, allows you to look through the product database and see detailed information about each product.

<h2>Step 3 - Technology Data</h2>

<p>
    Similar to the previous step, you can double-click the nodes on the ADAM website to edit their information. Additionally, you
