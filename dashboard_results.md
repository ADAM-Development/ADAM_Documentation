<h3>Results Summary</h3>

<p>
    The <b>results summary</b> has several categories: <b>total social welfare, total revenue, total supply cost, total transportation cost, total technology operational cost, total annulized investment cost</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    The <b>total social welfare is the net economic performance of the system</b>. It can be calculated by summing up all the costs and subtracting it from the total revenue. A positive number indicates that the system is profiting, and a negative number indicates that the system is suffering a loss. In this case, the system has a social welfare of +505,756 million USD/year which indicates that it is profiting in this scenario. 
</p>

<p>
    The <b>total revenue is the amount of money that the demand nodes give to the system to get a product</b>. In this case, it is zero because the disposal node is not paying any money to obtain the waste product. 
</p>

<p>
    The <b>total supply cost is the money that the system pays the supplier in order for the supplier to provide the product</b>. For example, a dairy farmer needs to get paid in order to offer their milk to the market. In a waste management scenario, the opposite is true. Waste is an undesireable product so suppliers will pay the system in order to get rid of their waste. This results in a negative supply cost since the system is actually profiting from the supply of waste. In this case, the supply cost is -975,000 million USD/year. This means that the system is gaining 975,000 million USD/year from the suppliers.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>total transportation cost is the money spent to transport the goods</b>. In this case, the transportation costs are 405,201.90 million USD/year. 
</p>

<p>
    The <b>total operational cost is the money spent to operate the technology</b>. In this case, the operating cost is $64,042 million USD/year. 
</p>

<p>
    The <b>investment cost is the money spent to build the technology</b>. In this case it is zero because the technologies were already built.

<h3>Download Results</h3> 

<p>
    You can also download the results in the form of csv files for more detailed information. There may be a different number of csv files depending on the number of products that you have in your system; however, all models will have a clearing_prices.csv, demand_results.csv, results_summary.csv, supply_results.csv, techsite_results.csv.
