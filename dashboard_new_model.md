<h1>Making a New Model from Scratch</h1>

<p>
    After understanding all of the files needed to make a model in ADAM, lets now go over how to use those files to create a new model.  
</p>

<h2>Creating a new Model</h2>

<p>
    First, navigate to your model list by selecting <b>Manage Models</b> on the dashboard homepage. Next select <b>New Model</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    You will be prompted to enter the model name and description. The description of the model should provide a brief overview on the purpose of the model or what problem it is attempting to solve. 
</p>

<p>
    After selecting <b>Yes</b>, the model will be added to your model list.
</p>

<h2>Entering information in the Model</h2>

<p>
    Clicking on the model will bring you into a progress bar screen with a row of buttons labeled from step 1 through 6 and another row of buttons with various options. 
</p>

<p>
    The first row of buttons is where you will go to enter information about the model. The second row of buttons gives you options for what you can do with the model. It is best to use these options once the model data is complete. 
</p>

<h2>Step 1 - Model Type</h2>

<p>
    Begin inputing data by selecting <b>Step 1</b>. You will be taken to a page where you can define the model type and the time basis. 
</p>

<p>
    The default model type is a <b>Supply Chain Design</b> type model, and the default time basis is <b>Year</b>. A design type model is used when your data contains technology candidates, and you would like to determine whether to build a technology or not.
</p>

<p>
    The time basis is up to you. Just keep in mind that you will need to have your data in terms of that time basis; additionally, the results will be in the selected time units.
</p>

<p>
    In this example, we will leave it as the default settings. Clicking <b>Confirm</b> will bring you to the next step.
</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Suppy Data</h2>

<p>
    Step 2 is where you can add supply data to the model. Use the first three options to upload data. For a review on how each option works, please refer to the 
<a href="/ADAM_Documentation/dashboard_input_data.md">Adding Data to a Model Tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For this example, we will be using the files located at 
<a href="https://github.com/mshen42/ADAM_Documentation/tree/main/Downloadable_content/Example">this link</a>. After uploading the example supply file, the model should look like this: 
</p>

<p>
    Then click <b>Next</b> to save the supply data and proceed to the next step. 
</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Technology Data</h2>

<p>
    In step 3, we will upload our technology data using the same method as before. When uploading the technology data, make sure to toggle the <b>Type</b> to match the file. 
</p>

<p>
    ADAM only allows you to upload one file at a time so first select <b>Technology Site Data</b> as the type and upload the example technology site file, then select <b>Upload Data</b> again and repeat the process with the technology candidate file. 
</p>

<p>
    If you uploaded the example files correctly, the model should look like this: 
</p>

<p>
    Then, click <b>Next</b> in order to save the technology data and proceed to the next step. 
</p>

<h2>Step 4 - Demand Data</h2>

<p>
    Similar to the supply and technology data, we will upload a csv file containing the demand data in step 4. After uploading the example, the model should look like this:
</p>

<p>
    Then click <b>Next</b> to save the demand data and proceeed to the next step. 
</p>

<h2>Step 5 - Transport Data</h2>
