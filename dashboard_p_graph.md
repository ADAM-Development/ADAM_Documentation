<h1>Process Graph (P-Graph)</h1>

<p>
    As long as you have technology data inputted in the model, you can access the Process graph. A process graph is a diagram that contains all possible combinations of the technologies and products in the system. This allows you to quickly and easily identify all potential supply chain pathways. 
</p>

<p>
    In a process diagram, raw materials are depicted as yellow circles, technologies are depicted as gray rectangles, intermediate products are depicted as blue circles, and final products are depicted as green circles.

<h2>P-Graph Example</h2>

<p>
    The example below shows a p-graph for a generic system containing three technologies. 
</p>

<p>
    In this example, the raw material can go through technology 1 or technology 2. Technology 1 produces a final product, which can then be sold to customers. Technology 2 produces an intermediate product, which can be futher processed via technology 3, and it produces a different final product than technology 1. 
</p>

<h2>Nutrient Pollution Control Example</h2>

<p>
    Technologies do not have to take in only one material and only output one product. There can be many combinations of materials, technologies, and products. An example of a simplified p-graph for the nutrient pollution case study is shown below.

<p>
    In this example, raw manure can go through solid liquid separation (SLS) technology or P Release technology. SLS produces two intermediate products, the solid component can be futher processed into pellets while the liquid component can go through P release technology to generate phosphorus. 
</p>

<h2>Waste to Energy Example</h2>

<p>
    The image below shows an example of a P-Graph generated by ADAM. This is the P-graph shown for the Waste to Energy case study. Based on the P-Graph, the Waste to Energy case study only has one type of technology in the system which is an Anaerobic Digestion + Electricity generation technology.
