<h1>Biogas From Waste Example</h1> 

<h2>Background Information</h2> 

<p>In the Biogas From Waste example, cattle farms produce manure which is then processed by technology sites. These technology sites use anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. This biogas is then purchased by customers.</p>

<p>Since there are many cattle farms, technology sites, and consumers, there are many combinations of pathways that the manure and biogas can take. We would like to find out which pathway is the most economically favorable.</p>

<p>Since we only want to manage sites that already exist, this type of problem can be defined as a management-type model. </p>
