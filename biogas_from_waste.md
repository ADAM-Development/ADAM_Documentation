<h1>Biogas From Waste Example</h1> 

<h2>Background Information</h2> 

<p>In the Biogas From Waste example, cattle farms produce manure which is then processed by technology sites. These technology sites use anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. This biogas is then purchased by customers.</p>

<p>Since there are many cattle farms, technology sites, and consumers, there are many combinations of pathways that the manure and biogas can take. We would like to find out which pathway is the most economically favorable.</p>

<p>We only want to manage sites that already exist; we are not considering building new technology sites. This type of problem can be defined as a management-type model. </p>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Outline</h3>

<p>In order to navigate to the biogas from waste example, click the <b>Tutorial</b> on the top right and select the <b>Biogas from Waste</b> option. The first screen you encounter is the <b>Example Outline Page</b>. This page provides an overview of the steps we will go over during the tutorial. 
</p>

<p>You may select any of the icons to jump to that part of the tutorial. For first-time users, we reccomend selecting the <b>Preliminary - Input Data</b> step.

<h3>Preliminary - Input Data</h3> 

<p>The first page of the tutorial gives you information about the input data needed for ADAM. This input data consists of supply data, demand data, technology data, and transportation data.</p>

<h5>The Supplier Data</h5>

<p>In the case of biogas to waste, the suppliers are CAFOs which produce cattle manure. The supplier data includes several pieces of information about each CAFO: their location, the amount of manure produced (capacity), and the cost of the waste to the supplier. 
</p>

<h5>The Consumer Data</h5>

<p>The consumers are any person or organization that purchases a valuable products. Similar to the supplier data, the consumer data includes the following information about each consumer: their location, the maximum amount of product they can purchase (capacity), and the unit price at which they are buying the product. In this case, the only product of value is the biogas produced by the technology sites. 
</p>

<h5>The Technology Data</h5>

<p>Technologies are any construct that can transform one product into another. In the context of biogas from waste, the technology being used is an anerobic digester uses cattle manure to produce biogas (main product) and digestate (waste product). The technology data includes the location and type of technology installed. 
</p>

<h5>The Transportation Data</h5>

<p>The transportation data includes information on the transportation costs of each product based on distance traveled.

<h3>Step 1 - Model Type</h3>

<p>Now that we have gone over the input data for this example, we can now select the model-type and time-basis. As stated before, since we are only focusing on managing existing technologies, we select a management type model rather than a design-type model (the custom model demonstrates the design type-model).
</p>

<p>The time basis is set to <b>Year</b>. When defining the capacities, make sure the units are consistent with the time basis selected.
