<h1>Nutrient Pollution Control</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    Nutrient pollution occurs when the run off from cow manure carries nutrients to a nearby body of water; these nutirents then support harmful algal blooms (HABs). These HABs grow at a rapid, uncontrolled rate and produce toxins which are harmful to humans and wildlife. Not only that, HABs consume a large amount of oxygen when they decay which can suffocate the aquatic life in that body of water.

<p>
    The Nutrient Pollution Control case study attempts to reduce nutrient run off (and thus reducing HAB growth) by encouraging farms to apply their waste onto crop fields which demand nutrients.
