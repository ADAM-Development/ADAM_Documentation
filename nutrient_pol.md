<h1>Nutrient Pollution Control</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    <b>Nutrient pollution</b> occurs when the run off from cow manure carries nutrients to a nearby body of water; these nutirents then support <b>harmful algal blooms (HABs)</b>. These HABs grow at a rapid, uncontrolled rate and produce toxins which are harmful to humans and wildlife. Not only that, HABs consume a large amount of oxygen when they decay which can suffocate the aquatic life in that body of water. 
</p>

<p>
    The Nutrient Pollution Control case study attempts to reduce nutrient run off by redirecting the nutrients to support crop growth rather than HABs. This is done by processing the waste into phosphorus or pellets, then applying the phosphorus to croplands or selling the pellets to a consumer. However, this process is very expensive so phosphorus incentives are applied. As the price of phosphorus increases, it gets more expensive to buy phosphorus fertilizers. Eventually, the price of using technologies to produce phosphorus becomes cheaper than buying the fertilizers.

<p>
    This case study applies phosphorus incentives of $0, $0.5, $2.5, and $10 USD/kg P in order to determine how much waste is processed and how much phosphorus is recovered.

<h2>Process Graph</h2>

<p>
    For the Nutrient Pollution Control case study, there are many products and technologies interacting with each other. This simplified process graph helps describe the potential products of the supply chain.

    In this system, there are three types of technologies: Solid Liquid Separation (SLS), Granulation, and P Release. SLS technologies take in raw cow manure and separates it into solid and liquid components. Granulation technologies take in the solid component from SLS technology and creates pellets which are used as fertilizers. P Release technologies are a pseudo technology that produces phosphorus from raw, solid, or liquid manure.
