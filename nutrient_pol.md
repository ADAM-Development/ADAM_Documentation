<h1>Nutrient Pollution Control</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    <b>Nutrient pollution</b> occurs when the run off from cow manure carries nutrients to a nearby body of water; these nutirents then support <b>harmful algal blooms (HABs)</b>. These HABs grow at a rapid, uncontrolled rate and produce toxins which are harmful to humans and wildlife. Not only that, HABs consume a large amount of oxygen when they decay which can suffocate the aquatic life in that body of water. 
</p>

<p>
    The Nutrient Pollution Control case study attempts to reduce nutrient run off by redirecting the nutrients to support crop growth rather than HABs. This is done by changing the price of the phosphorus product. As the price of phosphorus increases, it gets more expensive to buy phosphorus fertilizers. Eventually, the price of using technologies to process waste becomes cheaper than buying the fertilizers.
