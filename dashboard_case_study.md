<h1>Published Case Studies</h1>

<p>
    The case studies section of the dashboard contains published case studies which are already defined and solved. In addition to viewing these case studies and their results, you can make copies of these case studies and try running them for yourself.

    In this tutorial, we will go through the steps of copying a case study into your model list and demonstrate what you can do with the copied model once it is in your model list.
