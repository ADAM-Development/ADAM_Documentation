<h1>Published Case Studies</h1>

<p>
    The case studies section of the dashboard contains published case studies which are already defined and solved. In addition to viewing these case studies and their results, you can make copies of these case studies and try running them for yourself.
</p>

<p>
    In this tutorial, we will go through the steps of copying a case study into your model list and demonstrate what you can do with the copied model once it is in your model list.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Navigate to the Desired Case Study</h2>

<p>
    Click on the case studies icon to navigate into the published case studies.
</p>

<p>
    Next, select the published case study that you would like to copy. In this example, we will be selecting the <b>Waste to Energy</b> example. 
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Make a copy</h2>

<p>
    Once you have navigated to the case study, select <b>Make a Copy</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Next, edit the model name as desired and click <b>Yes</b>. This will create a copy of the Low Electricity Price scenario for the Waste to Energy case study. 
</p>

<p>
    Navigate to the model list (click <b>Manage Models</b> on the dashboard homepage) to see the copy of the case study. 
</p>

<p>
    Once you have created a copy of the model, you can make changes to the case study or run it as is. In the next section of the tutorial, we will go over how to run the case study and what changes you can make to the case study data.

<h2>The Copied Case Study</h2>

<p>
    Clicking on the case study in your model list will take you to an overview of the model. 
</p>

<p>
    The steps in the progress bar are as follows: (1) Define model type, (2) Add supply data, (3) Add technology data, (4) Add demand data, (5) Add transportation data, (6) Run model. 
</p>

<p>
    Notice that the model status is <b>Data Required</b>. That is because only steps 1 - 4 are completed for a copied model. You may click through the completed steps to view the model data, but in order to run the model, you must complete step 5. Do this by selecting <b>Generate Transportation Routes</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    After this, you can run the model. Once the status is <b>Completed</b>, you may view the model results. 
</p>

<p>
    The results will show a summary of the economic performance of the system, along with a section for downloading the results (in the form of csv files), and a link to the visualization tool.

<h2>Step 1 - Model Type</h2>

<p>
    When you enter each step in the progress bar, a new option will appear at the top with the name of the model. This will take you back to the model's progress bar. 
</p>

<p>
    Clicking on already completed steps will allow you to see the model data. For step 1, we can see that the copied model is a design-type model with an annual time basis. 
</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Supply Data</h2>

<p>
    For step 2, you can view and edit the supply nodes of the copied model. Double-click the nodes to edit their information. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to editing existing nodes, you may also add new data. <b>Upload Data</b> is used when you want to upload many new data points which are contained in a csv file.
